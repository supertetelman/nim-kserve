# There are 3 things in thie file that may need updating from the user, all based off the information in the NGC model tag
# This model comes from https://registry.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/ohlfw0olaadg/teams/ea-participants/models/llama-2-7b with latest tag 'LLAMA-2-7B-4K-FP16-1-A100.24.01'
# Based on this tag, the model requires 1-A100 gpu and the NIM runtime version is 24.01, these values must be set below if a different model version was downloaded.
